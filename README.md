# 🌸 HAPPIFY — Daily Joy Companion

HAPPIFY is a **science-backed happiness companion web app** designed to help users practice happiness daily through awareness, balance, and small intentional habits.

This is **not a therapy app**, **not a motivational quotes app**, and **not a crisis intervention tool**.  
HAPPIFY focuses on **practical happiness practices** covering the body, mind, digital wellness, work/study life, and emotional grounding.

HAPPIFY is built on the idea that sustainable happiness comes from:
